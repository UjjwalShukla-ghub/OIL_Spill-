# OIL_Spill-
This is a imbalanced classification task on oil-spill dataset.

# Dataset
As of details provided on the kaggle, this dataset was introduced in the 1998 paper by Miroslav Kubat, et al. titled Machine Learning for the Detection of Oil Spills in Satellite Radar Images. The dataset is often credited to Robert Holte, a co-author of the paper. The dataset was developed by starting with satellite images of the ocean, some of which contain an oil spill and some that do not. Images were split into sections and processed using computer vision algorithms to provide a vector of features to describe the contents of the image section or patch.
Dataset contains 937 images' vectors each having 50 features. The target variable is a binary one where '1' means case of oil-spillage and '0' means not a case of oil-spillage.
